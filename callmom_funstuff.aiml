<!-- 
Here is something that should amaze and impress your friends.
They will believe that your phone can identify them just
from pointing the camera at them and asking who they are.

However, what they don't know is that you say a
different set of words depending on who you want
to identify. You can add as many people as you like
as long as you remember the phrases for each one.
Have fun! - Steve Worswick -->
